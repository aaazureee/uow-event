# Event Booking System
A web application that simulates an event booking system for my university, using Node.js, Express and MongoDB. The system provides the following functions: 
- Event  creation  and  management:  Staff-level users  can  create  and  launch  a  new  event,  or  adjust  the  
price, dates/sessions, promotional codes, capacities, etc. on an existing event.  
- Event booking: System users can view the list of events, make a booking, and modify or cancel an existing booking.  
- User management: System users can view their profile and activity log (history). Users can also update their personal details such as email and password.
